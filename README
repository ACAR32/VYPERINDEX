# üåÄ CurveIndex Protocol

**CurveIndex** is a trustless, Curve-native ERC-20 index token representing a diversified basket of Curve LP tokens. It is built to capture long-term yield, enforce governance-driven composition, and maintain a liquid market through Curve pools without offering constant redemption.

---

## üß± Protocol Overview

- Built on **Curve Finance**, no Convex dependency
- Holds and accumulates Curve LP tokens
- Locks all CRV emissions into **veCRV**
- Built to be **priced and traded as a commodity**
- Enables **governance-directed index composition**
- Designed for **long-term alignment** through locking and delayed redemption

## üõ† Contracts

| Contract                   | Description                                                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CurveIndex.vy`            | Core contract handling LP deposits, redemptions, and ETH treasury      |
| `veCRVINDEX.vy`            | 4-week lock contract for governance participation                      |
| `CurveIndexGovernance.vy` | Trustless governance for proposing and voting on LP composition         |

## üîÅ Redemption Mechanics

- **Redemption is only allowed during active governance voting windows (3 days)**
- Users may burn `crvINDEX` to receive a **pro-rata share of the LPs**
- A **0.25% withdrawal fee** is applied to all LPs withdrawn
- Fee is retained in the protocol treasury
- Outside of this window, `crvINDEX` is **non-redeemable and only tradable**

---

## üó≥ Governance

- Governance power is granted only to lockers in `veCRVINDEX`
- Lock period: **4 weeks**
- Voting weight: **1 token = 1 vote**
- Proposal threshold: **0.1% of the total locked supply**
- Governance proposals determine:
  - Which Curve LPs are added to the index
  - Potential reweighting or structural changes

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Peg Stability & Market Making

- The protocol deploys a **Curve pool (e.g. crvINDEX/ETH)** for liquid secondary market trading
- It may direct **veCRV votes** and CRV emissions to incentivize this pool
- The protocol itself can act as a **peg-stabilizing market maker**
  - Buy `crvINDEX` from market when below NAV
  - Sell when trading above NAV to grow treasury
- Redemption window provides **price floor and NAV anchoring**

---

## üí∞ Fees & Emissions

- 0.25% fee on redemptions during governance voting windows
- CRV emissions from LPs are automatically locked to build veCRV voting power
- All ETH sent to the contract is accumulated into a treasury and used strategically

---

## üîê Trustless Infrastructure

- No multisig or admin roles after deployment
- Governance is controlled entirely by **long-term lockers**
- All decisions are **on-chain, transparent, and enforceable**

---

## üîß Coming Soon

- NAV Oracle & UI
- Peg rebalancing vault contract
- Curve factory pool deployment
- Governance front-end for proposal creation and voting
